      <h1>Welcome to Laura Travis's Programming Portfolio (WIP)</h1>
      <section class="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 33 year-old female with a Master's Degree in Mathematics and a Minor in Computer Science. Since 2021, I have been using sites such as w3schools and codecademy to deepen and expand my programming knowledge. Since 2016, I have been working as a full-time high school math teacher, but I have grown tired of the low pay coupled with the long hours. Programming has always interested me and I have always loved technology, puzzles, and challenging my mind. In the past, I have done some minor modding of computer games and frequently use complex excel formulas and formatting at work to make my job easier.</p>
        <p>I have greatly enjoyed learning new programming languages and how websites are built and modified. Eventually, I hope to become a remote Software Engineer, but I am currently hoping to find a remote job as a Junior Developer so that I can gain the experience necessary to be a successful Software Engineer. My preferred area of programming is working with Javascript as a back-end developer, but I am comfortable with the front-end as well. As someone who has used multiple websites and programs that are less than ideal and felt the frustration that comes from an incomplete design, I am passionate about helping to create websites that provide an optimal and seamless user experience.</p>
